# House-Price-Predictions
Machine Learning model for house price prediction in Milan

In this project, the goal was to predict house prices in different Italian cities using two datasets. The first
dataset, train.csv, contains data for one apartment for sale per row, and the target variable is the sale price.
The second dataset, poi.csv, contains the coordinates of points of interest that we can use to further enrich
the features available in our training dataset.
In this report, I will first describe the data cleaning and preparation process, followed by the feature en-
gineering process. I will then explain the machine learning algorithms we used to make predictions and
evaluate the final modelâ€™s performance
